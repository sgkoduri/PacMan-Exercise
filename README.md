# PacMan-Exercise

In this project, there are two buttons on the page. One button (“Add PacMan”) allows you to add a new PacMan that appears at a random position on the screen. The other button (“Start Game”) causes each PacMan to begin moving at a random velocity. A PacMan can still be added even after the game has been started. When a PacMen hits the edge of a screen, it changes positions so it can stay in the page’s frame.

# How to Run this Project
